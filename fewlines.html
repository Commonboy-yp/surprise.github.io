    well meeting you was a nice accident.. we know each other for long but we were'nt close
    but bloody destiny that put us together in the same class and give us the chance to know
    each other.I still remember the first day of 11th class when everyone is new to each other
    there was us.we know each other but that day something happen we sit,we talk,we laugh and more
    laugh,we laugh so much that PK told us to sit separately and that was the day our Bond form..
    well there was a drastic change in you and that change was good that was best version
    of you and more to come.I wish you read the whole para..I dont know whats gonna happen in the 
    future we gonna stay connected or we go our separate ways,but i know one thing for sure 
    when were you read this you will remember me and this will put a smile on your face..And that 
    smile is enough for me..So all the best for your journey.. 
    (FUCK THE PAST,LEAVE THE FUTURE AND LIVE THE PRESENT)...smile bhandh..
